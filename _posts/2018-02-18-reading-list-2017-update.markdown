<h2 class="title">Reading technology</h2>

A few items that rocked my world with respect to reading:

<h3>Borrowing eBooks from my local libraries</h3>

I've been a Kindle user for about 9 years now. Sometime in the past 5 years, I discovered that it was possible to borrow eBooks from your local library, but the user experience left a lot to be desired. The selection of eBooks available for borrowing via Overdrive was not that impressive, and the experience of downloading a DRM-protected ePub or Kindle book to your computer, then copying it over to your Kindle was clunky and not very user-friendly. 

How far we've come today...

As I recently rediscovered, the Overdrive system has gotten a lot smoother, better integrated with library systems and with Amazon, and has an impressive collection of new-ish books. The selection of books available to borrow still depends on which library systems you have access to. From having moved recently, I had library cards from where I lived before and where I now live. On top of that, the LA Public Library system kindly provides a library card to all California residents who brave LA traffic and visit a branch in person. All put together, this gives me access to quite a wealth of popular and recent books.

<h3>The Libby app by Overdrive</h3>
The same Overdrive system that lets you borrow library books has also launched a differently skinned app called <a href="https://meet.libbyapp.com" target="_blank">Libby</a>. The Libby app connects to any libraries you have cards for via the same Overdrive platform, so if you are looking to only borrow eBooks, you can go through either Overdrive or Libby, but the different thing here is the experience of borrowing audiobooks. With Libby, it gives you a list of all available audiobooks by library, and borrowing an audiobook is as easy as clicking 'Borrow' and the book will immediately start buffering / streaming through your phone. The app also makes samples available if you'd rather not commit to borrowing the book.

<h3>Fire HD 10</h3>
Amazon has had this on sale on and off for $99 + taxes - if you find such a deal, get it! With the fairly easy to execute <a href="https://boingboing.net/2017/10/11/quickly-add-the-google-play-st.html" target="_blank">Google Play sideload trick</a>, you not only have the wealth of Amazon apps but also the vast world of Android apps on Google Play, including Netflix, Google Drive/Calendar/Mail, Microsoft's Office 365 apps etc.

Fire HD also comes with a 6-month complementary membership to Washington Post, and a $5/year subscription to Wired magazine. 

The experience of reading on the old gen Kindle was amazing - since the basic "paperwhite" Kindles aren't backlit, there is no strain on the eyes from the tablet. The Fire HD 10 is backlit, but it has multiple options on making the screen darker (white-text-on-black background) on dimming the tablet for 'night mode' 

I was specifically looking for a tablet that could do a decent job of letting me doodle / draw wireframes/mockups/brainstorm charts without me having to invest $700-$900 for a complete iPad Pro + Pencil ecosystem, and I'm happy to report that Fire 10 HD by itself is enough for some basic level of doodling.

One word of warning - for a $100 tablet, you get what you pay for with the screen - it is not very strong and cracks easily. Put a case or screen protector on the Fire 10 HD the moment you get it.

<h3>Goodreads</h3>
I've had a Goodreads account for over 6 years now. I have seen Goodreads get acquired by Amazon, seen them get through various controversies over giving preferential treatment to author accounts, and primarily being too lazy to delete the account, I kept it open and sporadically updated my lists of books I'd like to read.

A couple of years ago, Goodreads helpfully started scanning my lists of 'Want to Read' books, looking up sales on the Kindle versions of those books on Amazon.com and sending me email digests of Goodreads Deals i.e. 'We found a great deal for an ebook on your Want to Read shelf!'. Well, wow. I've probably purchased at least one book every few emails, if not more. At $2 - $4 a book, I'm getting a real deal on bestselling books and I can keep my reading "pile" full of books that I actually want to read.

<h2 class="title">Books Read in 2017</h2>

<h3>1. <a href="http://amzn.to/1VIZUYR" target="_blank">Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion</a> by Robert B. Cialdini (1984)</h3>	
<p align="center"><a href="http://amzn.to/1VIZUYR" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aannasw/aannasw.github.io/master/assets/images/posts/reading-list/influence.jpg" /></a></p>
I loved this book! The concepts of persuasion outlined in this book are timeless, even if in some cases, the examples aren't - case in point, I don't know of anyone who refers to "confidence-men" anymore. Although the use cases are sometimes stuck in the 80s, the author's underlying message is powerful and worth absorbing. 

<h3>2. <a href="http://amzn.to/1OCxYQN" target="_blank">Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time</a> by Dava Sobel (2010)</h3>	
<p align="center"><a href="http://amzn.to/1OCxYQN" target="_blank"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aannasw/aannasw.github.io/master/assets/images/posts/reading-list/longitude-dava-sobel.jpg" /></a></p>
This book hit a lot of relevant notes for me - travel, entrepreneurship, innovation, challenges of communicating new technology. What I didn't realize, and now have a new appreciation for, is the connection between accurate timekeeping and navigating the seas.

<h3>3. The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood</h3>
<iframe type="text/html" width="336" height="550" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="max-width:100%" src="https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?asin=B003JFJHTS&preview=inline&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_CqCIAbR9GSAPJ" ></iframe>
Dystopian and disturbing. The writing was great, the book was a page-turner and the main character's inner life felt authentic. It's the sort of book that stayed with me, even as I wondered how truly 'futuristic' or 'dystopian' this world really was when women still have so far to go and so much to change to feel truly equal.

<h3>4. To Pixar and Beyond: My Unlikely Journey with Steve Jobs to Make Entertainment History by Lawrence Levy</h3>
<iframe type="text/html" width="336" height="550" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="max-width:100%" src="https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?asin=B01912OSA0&preview=inline&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_HqCIAbBQ996HN" ></iframe>
Pixar recently released Coco, which I absolutely loved and recommend as an example of what authentic ethnic storytelling should look like. News also came out regarding a pattern of alleged misconduct by John Lasseter, the Chief Creative Officer at Pixar. This book serves as an interesting point-in-time capture of Lawrence Levy's recollections of his time at Pixar - starting just before Toy Story was released, and ending around the time Disney fully acquired Pixar.

<h3>5. On Writing: A Memoir Of the Craft by Stephen King</h3>
<iframe type="text/html" width="336" height="550" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="max-width:100%" src="https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?asin=B000FC0SIM&preview=inline&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_NqCIAbZJB43DB" ></iframe>

<h3>6. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child by J.K.Rowling</h3> 
<iframe type="text/html" width="336" height="550" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="max-width:100%" src="https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?asin=B073P962D9&preview=inline&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_WdCIAb0BCF234" ></iframe>

<h3>7. The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman</h3>
<iframe type="text/html" width="336" height="550" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="max-width:100%" src="https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?asin=B0011UJM48&preview=inline&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_UrCIAbR39C7E5" ></iframe>
